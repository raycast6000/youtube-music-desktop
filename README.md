# YouTube Music for Desktop
This is an unofficial desktop adaptation for the YouTube Music web application. Precompiled binaries can be found [here](https://github.com/raycast6000/youtube-music-desktop/releases/). \
**Currently there are two branches:**
- Master (mainly maintained)
> For the Tauri version, which is faster than Electron.
- Electron
> For the old Electron version, which is slower and a little buggy.
